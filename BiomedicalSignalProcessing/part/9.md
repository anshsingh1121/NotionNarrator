# Cardiac Electrophysiology: Action Potentials and Pacemaker Cells

This document outlines the fundamental principles of cardiac action potentials, focusing on both the contractile cardiac muscle cells and the pacemaker cells of the Sinoatrial (SA) node.

## Cardiac Muscle Cell Action Potential

The action potential in a cardiac muscle cell (myocyte) is distinct from that of skeletal muscle or neurons, primarily due to its extended plateau phase. This prolonged depolarization is crucial for allowing the heart enough time to contract and pump blood effectively.

### Phases of the Cardiac Action Potential
1.  **Resting Membrane Potential (RMP):** The cell is at rest at approximately -90mV.
2.  **Depolarization:** An incoming stimulus causes a rapid influx of sodium ions (Na+), causing the membrane potential to shoot up to about +20mV.
3.  **Plateau Phase:** This is the defining feature. After the initial spike, the cell remains depolarized for an extended period (around 200ms). This is caused by a slow influx of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) which is balanced by an efflux of potassium ions (K⁺). This prolonged refractory period prevents tetanus (sustained contraction) in the heart muscle.
4.  **Repolarization:** The calcium channels close, and potassium channels remain open, allowing K⁺ ions to exit the cell. This efflux of positive ions brings the membrane potential back down to its resting state of -90mV.

### Role of Calcium Influx
The influx of Ca²⁺ during the plateau phase is critical not just for maintaining the action potential, but also for initiating muscle contraction. The process is as follows:

*   The presence of open Ca²⁺ channels leads to an increase in intracellular calcium.
*   This initial calcium influx triggers the release of much larger stores of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via T-tubules.
*   The high concentration of intracellular calcium initiates the process of muscle contraction.
*   When the Ca²⁺ channels close and calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes.

This entire cycle of depolarization and repolarization creates a time delay that allows for the mechanical compression (contraction) and relaxation of the heart muscle.

## The SA Node and Pacemaker Potential

The Sinoatrial (SA) node is the heart's natural **pacemaker**. Unlike other muscle cells, its cells can generate their own electrical impulses without any external stimuli.

### Mechanism of Pacemaker Potential
SA node cells do not have a stable resting membrane potential. Instead, they exhibit a slow, spontaneous depolarization known as the **pacemaker potential**.

1.  **Initial Depolarization (Funny Current):** The potential starts at around -60mV and slowly drifts upwards. This is primarily due to a special type of channel called the "Funny Channel," which allows a slow, continuous influx of Na⁺. This is known as the **Funny Current (If)**.
2.  **Threshold and Action Potential:** When the slow depolarization reaches a threshold of approximately -40mV, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open, causing a rapid influx of calcium and generating the action potential spike.
3.  **Repolarization:** The Ca²⁺ channels then close, and K⁺ channels open, allowing potassium to exit the cell and repolarizing it back to -60mV, at which point the cycle begins again.

### Conduction to Myocardium
The electrical impulse generated by the SA node spreads to the adjacent contractile cardiac muscle cells (myocardium) through specialized intercellular connections called **gap junctions**. This stimulus from the SA node is what triggers the action potential in the surrounding muscle cells, which is why their action potential is described as "stimuli-based."

## Summary: The Central Role of Calcium

As highlighted in the notes, the entire process of muscle contraction and relaxation is fundamentally governed by the flow and concentration of **calcium** ions. Calcium is the key link between the electrical excitation of the cell membrane and the mechanical contraction of the muscle fibers (a process known as excitation-contraction coupling).
