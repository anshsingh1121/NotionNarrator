      "description": "# Ideal Inverters\n\nIn digital electronics, an **inverter**, or **NOT gate**, is a fundamental logic gate that implements logical negation. It outputs a state that is the opposite of its input. When the input is HIGH (logic 1), the output is LOW (logic 0), and vice-versa.\n\n## Logic Symbol and Truth Table\n\nThe standard symbol for an inverter is a triangle followed by a small circle, which indicates the inversion operation.\n\n![Logic symbol for an inverter or NOT gate](images/figure_1.png)\n\nThe behavior of an inverter is concisely described by its truth table:\n\n| Input (A) | Output (Y) |\n|:---------:|:----------:|\n| 0         | 1          |\n| 1         | 0          |\n\n## CMOS Inverter Implementation\n\nA common and power-efficient method to construct an inverter is by using Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. A CMOS inverter consists of a P-type MOS (PMOS) transistor and an N-type MOS (NMOS) transistor connected in series between the power supply and ground.\n\n![Circuit schematic of a CMOS inverter](images/figure_2.png)\n\n*   **PMOS Transistor (Load):** The top transistor is a PMOS, often referred to as the pull-up device. It connects the output to the positive supply voltage (`VDD`) when it is turned ON.\n*   **NMOS Transistor (Driver):** The bottom transistor is an NMOS, which acts as the pull-down device. It connects the output to ground (`GND`) when it is turned ON.\n*   **Operation:**\n    *   When the input `Vin` is LOW (0V, logic 0), the PMOS transistor turns ON, and the NMOS transistor turns OFF. This creates a direct path from `VDD` to `Vout`, pulling the output HIGH (to `VDD`, logic 1).\n    *   When the input `Vin` is HIGH (`VDD`, logic 1), the PMOS transistor turns OFF, and the NMOS transistor turns ON. This creates a direct path from `Vout` to ground, pulling the output LOW (to 0V, logic 0).\n\n## Signal Timing and Duty Cycle\n\nFor periodic digital signals, the **duty cycle** is a key parameter that describes the percentage of time the signal is in the HIGH or active state during one full period.\n\nThe formula is: `Duty Cycle = (T_on / T_total) * 100%`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_on` is the time the signal is HIGH.\n*   `T_total` is the total period of the signal (`T_on + T_off`).\n\n![A square wave signal with a 40% duty cycle](images/figure_3.png)\n\nFor the signal shown in the notes:\n*   `T_on` = 4 ms\n*   `T_off` = 6 ms\n*   `T_total` = 4 ms + 6 ms = 10 ms\n*   `Duty Cycle` = (4 ms / 10 ms) * 100% = 40%\n\n## Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) of an Ideal Inverter\n\nThe Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) is a graph that plots the output voltage (`Vout`) as a function of the input voltage (`Vin`). For an ideal inverter, this graph shows an infinitely sharp transition, representing perfect switching behavior.\n\n![Ideal Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve for a digital inverter](images/figure_4.png)\n\nKey features of an ideal VTC:\n\n*   **Rail-to-Rail Output:** The output voltage swings fully between the supply rails. The HIGH output voltage (`V_OH`) is equal to `VDD`, and the LOW output voltage (`V_OL`) is equal to 0.\n*   **Sharp Transition:** The transition between HIGH and LOW states occurs instantaneously at a specific input voltage known as the **switching threshold** (`V_M`).\n*   **Ideal Switching Threshold:** For a symmetric ideal inverter, the switching threshold is exactly at the midpoint of the supply voltage: `V_M = VDD / 2`.\n*   **Infinite Noise Margins:** Because the transition is perfectly vertical, the inverter has an extremely high gain at the switching point and is theoretically immune to noise as long as the noise doesn't push the input voltage across the `VDD/2` threshold. The input for 'logic 0' is defined as any voltage from `0` to just below `VDD/2`, and the input for 'logic 1' is any voltage from just above `VDD/2` to `VDD`."

      "description": "# Analysis of an NMOS Inverter\n\nThis document explains the fundamental operation of an NMOS transistor when used as a digital switch and as the core component of a logic inverter.\n\n## NMOS Transistor Circuit Symbols\n\nThe n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (NMOS) is a key component in digital logic. It can be represented in circuit diagrams using several standard symbols.\n\n![Various circuit symbols for an NMOS transistor](images/figure_1.png)\n\n## NMOS Transistor as a Digital Switch\n\nAn NMOS transistor functions effectively as an electronic switch. Its state, either ON (conducting) or OFF (non-conducting), is controlled by the voltage applied to its gate terminal relative to its source (`V_GS`), which corresponds to the input voltage (`V_in`).\n\n*   **Logic 0 (OFF State):** When the input voltage is below the transistor's threshold voltage (`0 <= V_in < V_tn`), the transistor is in the **cutoff region**. In this state, a conductive channel does not form between the drain and source, so ideally, no current flows (`I_D = 0`).\n*   **Logic 1 (ON State):** When the input voltage is greater than the threshold voltage (`V_tn < V_in < V_DD`), the transistor is turned ON. An **inversion layer**, which acts as a conductive channel, is formed beneath the gate. This allows current (`I_D`) to flow from the drain to the source.\n\n## The NMOS Inverter with a Load\n\nAn inverter is a fundamental logic gate that produces an output signal that is the logical inverse of its input. An NMOS inverter is built using an NMOS transistor as a pull-down switch and a load element (like a resistor) as a pull-up device, connected between the output node and the power supply `V_DD`.\n\n![Circuit diagram of an NMOS inverter with a generic load](images/figure_2.png)\n\n### Principle of Operation\n\nThe inverter's function is understood by analyzing its response to low and high logic inputs.\n\n1.  **Gate Characteristics:** The gate of a MOSFET is insulated from the channel by a thin layer of silicon dioxide. This layer acts as a capacitor and prevents any significant DC current from flowing into the gate. Therefore, the current passing through the load (`I_L`) is the same as the current flowing through the transistor's drain (`I_D`).\n    ```\n    I_L = I_D\n    ```\n\n2.  **Input is Logic Low (`V_in` < `V_tn`):**\n    *   With a low input voltage, the NMOS transistor remains **OFF** (in cutoff).\n    *   Since no inversion layer is formed, the drain current `I_D` is practically zero.\n    *   The output voltage (`V_out`) can be determined using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law for the output loop: `V_out = V_DD - I_L * R_load`.\n    *   With `I_L = I_D = 0`, the equation simplifies to `V_out = V_DD`.\n    *   Conclusion: A **low input** results in a **high output**.\n\n3.  **Input is Logic High (`V_in` > `V_tn`):**\n    *   With a high input voltage, the NMOS transistor turns **ON**, entering the active region.\n    *   The formation of the inversion layer allows a significant drain current `I_D` to flow through the transistor to ground.\n    *   This current creates a voltage drop across the load element (`I_L * R_load`).\n    *   Revisiting the output equation, `V_out = V_DD - I_L * R_load`, the non-zero voltage drop across the load causes `V_out` to decrease significantly.\n    *   In an ideal scenario, the ON transistor acts as a short circuit to ground, pulling the output voltage to a low level.\n    *   Conclusion: A **high input** results in a **low output**.\n\n![Simplified model of an NMOS transistor in the ON state as a short circuit](images/figure_3.png)"

      "description": "# The Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) of an NMOS Inverter\n\nThe Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) is a critical graph used in digital electronics to analyze the performance of an inverter. It plots the output voltage (`Vout`) as a function of the input voltage (`Vin`). This analysis helps in determining key parameters like noise margins, switching threshold, and operating regions of the logic gate.\n\n![The Voltage Transfer Characteristic graph for an NMOS inverter.](images/figure_1.png)\n\n## Key Voltage Parameters\n\nThe VTC graph defines several important voltage levels that characterize the inverter's behavior:\n\n*   **`VOH` (Output High Voltage):** This is the maximum output voltage when the output signal represents a logic '1'. Ideally, this is equal to the supply voltage, VDD.\n\n*   **`VOL` (Output Low Voltage):** This is the minimum output voltage when the output signal represents a logic '0'. Ideally, this is equal to ground (0V).\n\n*   **`VIL` (Input Low Voltage):** This is the maximum input voltage that the inverter will reliably recognize as a logic '0'. For any input voltage from 0 to `VIL`, the output is guaranteed to be `VOH`.\n\n*   **`VIH` (Input High Voltage):** This is the minimum input voltage that the inverter will reliably recognize as a logic '1'. For any input voltage from `VIH` to VDD, the output is guaranteed to be `VOL`.\n\n*   **`Vth` (Switching Threshold Voltage):** This is the input voltage at which `Vout` is equal to `Vin`. It represents the center of the transition region.\n\n## The Transition Region\n\nThe region on the VTC where the input voltage is between `VIL` and `VIH` is known as the transition or undefined region. As noted on the graph, in this range, the output is not a valid logic '1' or logic '0'. The inverter exhibits high gain in this region, making it very sensitive to small changes in input voltage.\n\nThe boundaries of this region are defined by the points where the gain of the inverter, `dVout/dVin`, is equal to -1.\n\n## Noise Margin\n\nNoise Margin is a crucial metric that quantifies an inverter's ability to tolerate noise on its input without changing its output state. In real-world digital circuits, logic levels are not represented by single voltage values but by a range of voltages.\n\n*   **Concept:** Noise margin explains the extent to which a digital Integrated Circuit (IC) can withstand voltage fluctuations (noise) during the transmission of signals. The received voltage range for a logic level can widen due to noise in the circuit. A sufficient noise margin is required for errorless transmission.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   **High Noise Margin (`NMH`):** This is the tolerance for noise when the output is at logic '1'. It is calculated as `NMH = VOH - VIH`.\n    *   **Low Noise Margin (`NML`):** This is the tolerance for noise when the output is at logic '0'. It is calculated as `NML = VIL - VOL`."
