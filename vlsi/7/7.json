      "description": "# Resistive Load Inverter\n\nAn inverter is a fundamental logic gate in digital electronics that outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic level to its input. The resistive load inverter is a simple implementation using an NMOS transistor as a switching element and a resistor as a load.\n\n## Circuit Diagram and Principle of Operation\n\nThe circuit consists of an N-channel MOSFET (NMOS) which acts as the pull-down network, and a passive resistor (R) which acts as the pull-up network. The input voltage (`Vin`) is applied to the gate of the NMOS transistor, and the output voltage (`Vout`) is taken at the drain.\n\n![Circuit diagram of a resistive load inverter](images/figure_1.png)\n\n### Initial Analysis\n\n*   **Input:** In this inverter configuration, the input signal is applied to the gate of the MOSFET.\n*   **Gate Current (`I_G`):** The gate of a MOSFET is electrically isolated from the channel by a thin layer of silicon dioxide (oxide layer). This acts as an insulator, so ideally, no DC current flows into the gate. Therefore, we assume `I_G = 0`.\n*   **Current Path:** Since the gate current is zero, the current flowing through the load resistor (`I_R`) must be equal to the current flowing through the transistor from drain to source (`I_D`). So, `I_R = I_D`.\n\n### Output Voltage using KVL\n\nBy applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the output loop (from VDD, through the resistor R, to Vout), we can define the relationship between the output voltage and the drain current:\n\n`Vout = VDD - I_R * R`\n\nSince `I_R = I_D`, the equation becomes:\n\n`Vout = VDD - I_D * R`\n\nThis is known as the **load line equation**, which describes the operating characteristics of the load.\n\n## Analysis of Logic States\n\nThe inverter's operation can be analyzed in two primary cases based on the input voltage level relative to the MOSFET's threshold voltage (`Vth`).\n\n### Case 1: Low Input (Vin < Vth)\n\n*   **Condition:** The input voltage `Vin` is less than the threshold voltage `Vth` of the NMOS transistor.\n*   **Transistor State:** The transistor is in the **cutoff region**. No inversion layer is formed in the channel, so it cannot conduct current.\n*   **Drain Current:** The drain current `I_D` is zero.\n*   **Output Voltage:** Substituting `I_D = 0` into the load line equation:\n    `Vout = VDD - (0) * R = VDD`\n*   **Conclusion:** A low input (`Vin` < `Vth`) results in a high output (`Vout` = `VDD`). This corresponds to **Logic '1'**.\n\n### Case 2: High Input (Vin > Vth)\n\n*   **Condition:** The input voltage `Vin` is greater than the threshold voltage `Vth`.\n*   **Transistor State:** The transistor turns **ON**, creating a conductive channel. It will operate in either the linear (triode) or saturation region depending on the value of `Vout`.\n*   **Drain Current:** A non-zero drain current `I_D` flows through the transistor.\n*   **Output Voltage:** The output voltage is given by `Vout = VDD - I_D * R`. Since `I_D` is positive, the output voltage will be lower than `VDD`. For a sufficiently high input voltage, the transistor is driven strongly into conduction, its resistance becomes very low, and `Vout` approaches 0V.\n*   **Conclusion:** A high input (`Vin` > `Vth`) results in a low output (`Vout` ≈ 0). This corresponds to **Logic '0'**."

      "description": "# MOSFET Drain Current Equations\n\nThese notes detail the fundamental equations governing the drain current (`I_D`) in an n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) for its two primary regions of operation: the linear (or triode) region and the saturation region.\n\n## 1. Linear (Triode) Region\n\nWhen a MOSFET operates in the linear region, it behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor. The resistance between the drain and source can be varied by changing the gate-to-source voltage (`V_GS`).\n\n### Condition for Linear Region\n\nA MOSFET is in the linear region when the gate-to-source voltage is above the threshold voltage, and the drain-to-source voltage is less than the overdrive voltage (`V_GS - V_th`).\n\n`V_GS - V_th > V_DS`\n\n*(Note: The original notes use `V_T0` for the threshold voltage and `V_out` for `V_DS`)*\n\n### Drain Current (I_D) Equation\n\nThe drain current in this region depends on both `V_GS` and `V_DS`:\n\n`I_D = (K/2) * [2(V_GS - V_th)V_DS - V_DS^2]`\n\nThis can also be expressed by substituting the formula for the process transconductance parameter, `K`:\n\n`I_D = (μn * C_ox * (W/L) / 2) * [2(V_GS - V_th)V_DS - V_DS^2]`\n\n## 2. Saturation Region\n\nIn the saturation region, the MOSFET acts as a voltage-controlled current source. Once the drain-to-source voltage (`V_DS`) reaches or exceeds the overdrive voltage (`V_GS - V_th`), the channel becomes \"pinched off\" at the drain end. Ideally, the drain current `I_D` then becomes independent of `V_DS` and is controlled solely by `V_GS`.\n\n### Condition for Saturation Region\n\nA MOSFET enters the saturation region when the drain-to-source voltage is greater than or equal to the overdrive voltage.\n\n`V_DS ≥ V_GS - V_th`\n\n*(Note: The original notes use `V_in` for `V_GS` and `V_out` for `V_DS`, expressing the condition as `V_in - V_th < V_out`)*\n\n### Drain Current (I_D) Equation\n\nThe drain current in saturation is given by:\n\n`I_D = (K/2) * (V_GS - V_th)^2`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `K`, we get:\n\n`I_D = (1/2) * μn * C_ox * (W/L) * (V_GS - V_th)^2`\n\n## Parameter Definitions\n\n*   **`I_D`**: The current flowing from the drain to the source terminal.\n*   **`V_GS`**: Gate-to-Source Voltage. The control voltage applied to the gate.\n*   **`V_DS`**: Drain-to-Source Voltage.\n*   **`V_th`** (or **`V_T0`**): The Threshold Voltage. The minimum `V_GS` required to create a conducting channel between the drain and source.\n*   **`K`**: The Process Transconductance Parameter, which depends on the physical characteristics of the device.\n*   **`μn`**: The mobility of electrons in the inversion layer (for an n-MOSFET).\n*   **`C_ox`**: The gate oxide capacitance per unit area.\n*   **`W`**: The width of the transistor's channel.\n*   **`L`**: The length of the transistor's channel. The ratio `(W/L)` is a key design parameter."

      "description": "# Working of a Resistive Load Inverter\n\nA resistive load inverter is a fundamental digital logic circuit that inverts a digital signal. It is typically constructed using a switching transistor (like an NMOS FET) and a passive resistor as the load element. When the input is high, the output is low, and vice-versa.\n\n## Voltage Transfer Curve (VTC)\n\nThe Voltage Transfer Curve (VTC) is a graph that plots the output voltage (`Vout`) against the input voltage (`Vin`). It is crucial for characterizing the performance of an inverter, showing its switching threshold, noise margins, and operating regions.\n\n![Voltage Transfer Curve for a Resistive Load Inverter](images/figure_1.png)\n\n### Key Parameters from the VTC:\n\n*   **VOH (Output High Voltage):** The maximum voltage at the output when the input represents a logic '0'. Ideally, this is equal to the supply voltage, `VDD`.\n*   **VOL (Output Low Voltage):** The minimum voltage at the output when the input represents a logic '1'. Ideally, this is 0V or ground.\n*   **VIL (Input Low Voltage):** The maximum input voltage that is reliably interpreted by the inverter as a logic '0'. It is defined as the point on the VTC where the slope `dVout/dVin = -1`.\n*   **VIH (Input High Voltage):** The minimum input voltage that is reliably interpreted as a logic '1'. It is also defined as the point on the VTC where the slope `dVout/dVin = -1`.\n\n## Analysis of Operating Regions\n\nThe behavior of the inverter is analyzed by considering the operating state of the NMOS transistor at different input voltage levels.\n\n### I. Calculating VOH (Output High)\n\nThis state occurs when the input voltage `Vin` is low (less than the transistor's threshold voltage, `Vth`).\n\n1.  The NMOS transistor is in the **cutoff region**, meaning it acts like an open switch.\n2.  As a result, the drain current (`ID`) flowing through the transistor is effectively zero (`ID = 0`).\n3.  The output voltage `Vout` is determined by the pull-up resistor `R` connected to the supply `VDD`. The formula is:\n    `Vout = VDD - ID * R`\n4.  Substituting `ID = 0` into the equation gives:\n    `Vout = VDD`\n5.  Therefore, the high output voltage level is equal to the supply voltage:\n    `VOH = VDD`\n\n### II. Calculating VOL (Output Low)\n\nThis state occurs when the input voltage `Vin` is high (e.g., `Vin = VDD`).\n\n1.  The NMOS transistor is turned on and operates in the **linear (or triode) region**. The condition for the linear region is `VDS < VGS - Vth`, which in this circuit translates to `Vout < Vin - Vth` (where `Vth` is the threshold voltage, sometimes denoted as `VTO`).\n2.  The drain current `ID` flowing through the transistor in the linear region is given by the formula:\n    `ID = (K/2) * [2*(Vin - Vth)*Vout - Vout^2]`\n    *   Here, `K` is the transconductance parameter of the transistor, which depends on its physical properties.\n3.  To find `VOL`, one would set the current through the transistor equal to the current through the load resistor (`ID = (VDD - Vout)/R`) and solve for `Vout` when `Vin` is at a high logic level. The resulting `Vout` is the `VOL` of the inverter."

      "description": "# Analysis of a Resistive-Load NMOS Inverter\n\nThese notes present the mathematical derivation for two critical parameters of a resistive-load NMOS inverter's Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC): the Output Low Voltage (`V_OL`) and the Input Low Voltage (`V_IL`). These parameters are essential for determining the inverter's noise margins and overall performance.\n\n### Key Variables\n*   `V_DD`: The positive supply voltage.\n*   `V_in`: The input voltage to the inverter.\n*   `V_out`: The output voltage from the inverter.\n*   `R`: The resistance of the pull-up load resistor.\n*   `I_D`: The drain current flowing through the NMOS transistor.\n*   `V_T0`: The threshold voltage of the NMOS transistor.\n*   `K`: The transconductance parameter of the NMOS transistor, defined as `K = μn * Cox * (W/L)`, where `μn` is the electron mobility, `Cox` is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, and `W/L` is the width-to-length ratio of the transistor.\n\n--- \n\n## I. Derivation of V_OL (Output Low Voltage)\n\n`V_OL` is the output voltage when the input is high (i.e., `V_in = V_DD`). In this state, the NMOS transistor is turned on and operating in its **linear (or triode) region**.\n\n1.  **Current Equations:** We equate the current flowing through the pull-up resistor (`I_R`) with the current flowing through the NMOS transistor (`I_D`).\n    *   Current through the resistor (Ohm's Law): `I_D = (V_DD - V_out) / R`\n    *   Current through the NMOS in the linear region: `I_D = (K/2) * [2(V_GS - V_T0)V_DS - V_DS^2]`\n\n2.  **Applying Conditions:** For `V_OL`, we set `V_in = V_DD` and `V_out = V_OL`. This means `V_GS = V_DD` and `V_DS = V_OL`.\n    \n3.  **Equating and Solving:** We set the two current equations equal to each other with the applied conditions:\n    ```\n    (V_DD - V_OL) / R = (K/2) * [2(V_DD - V_T0)V_OL - V_OL^2]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rearranging into Quadratic Form:** To solve for `V_OL`, we rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form (`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`):\n    ```\n    V_OL^2 - 2(V_DD - V_T0 + 1/(KR)) * V_OL + (2*V_DD)/(KR) = 0\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Solution:** Solving this quadratic equation for `V_OL` (and taking the physically meaningful smaller root) yields the final expression:\n    ```\n    V_OL = (V_DD - V_T0 + 1/(KR)) - sqrt[(V_DD - V_T0 + 1/(KR))^2 - (2*V_DD)/(KR)]\n    ```\n\n--- \n\n## II. Derivation of V_IL (Input Low Voltage)\n\n`V_IL` is a critical point on the VTC defined as the input voltage where the slope of the curve, `dV_out / dV_in`, is equal to **-1**. At this point, the NMOS transistor is operating in the **saturation region**.\n\n1.  **Saturation Condition:** The condition for the NMOS to be in saturation is `V_DS >= V_GS - V_T0`, which translates to `V_out > V_in - V_T0`.\n\n2.  **Current Equations:** We again equate the currents through the resistor and the transistor.\n    *   Current through the resistor: `I_D = (V_DD - V_out) / R`\n    *   Current through the NMOS in saturation: `I_D = (K/2) * (V_GS - V_T0)^2`\n    \n3.  **Equating Expressions:**\n    ```\n    (V_DD - V_out) / R = (K/2) * (V_in - V_T0)^2\n    ```\n\n4.  **Differentiation:** To find the point where the slope is -1, we differentiate the entire equation with respect to `V_in`:\n    ```\n    d/dV_in [ (V_DD - V_out) / R ] = d/dV_in [ (K/2) * (V_in - V_T0)^2 ]\n    \n    (-1/R) * (dV_out / dV_in) = K * (V_in - V_T0)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Applying the V_IL Condition:** We now substitute `V_in = V_IL` and the defining condition `dV_out / dV_in = -1` into the differentiated equation:\n    ```\n    (-1/R) * (-1) = K * (V_IL - V_T0)\n    \n    1/R = K * (V_IL - V_T0)\n    ```\n\n6.  **Final Solution:** Solving for `V_IL` gives the final, simplified expression:\n    ```\n    V_IL = V_T0 + 1/(KR)\n    ```"
