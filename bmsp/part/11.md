# Understanding the ECG Waveform

An Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a crucial diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart over time. The waveform produced provides valuable information about the heart's function and health. The notes break down the different components of a standard ECG trace.

## Core Concepts: Waves, Segments, and Intervals

The ECG waveform is composed of three primary types of features:

*   **Wave:** Represents a specific electrical event in the heart, such as the depolarization (contraction) or repolarization (relaxation/reset) of a heart chamber. Examples include the P wave and T wave.
*   **Segment:** The duration between two distinct points on the waveform, which is typically a flat line along the **isoelectric line** (the baseline). It represents a period where there is no change in electrical potential.
*   **Interval:** A duration that includes at least one wave and a segment. It represents the total time for one or more cardiac events to occur.

## Detailed Breakdown of the ECG Components

### Waves
*   **P Wave:** Represents **atrial depolarization**, which is the electrical activation of the atria, leading to their contraction (pumping blood into the ventricles).
*   **QRS Complex:** Represents **ventricular depolarization**, the electrical activation of the ventricles. This event triggers the contraction of the ventricles to pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. Its complex shape is due to the path the electrical signal takes through the ventricular muscle.
*   **T Wave:** Represents **ventricular repolarization**, the period when the ventricles are electrically resetting for the next heartbeat.

### Atrial Repolarization
A key point is that **atrial repolarization** (the resetting of the atria) is not normally seen on an ECG. This is because it occurs at the same time as ventricular depolarization. The electrical signal from the QRS complex is much larger and therefore **masks** the signal from atrial repolarization.

### Segments and Intervals
*   **PR Interval:** Measures the time from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. It represents the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel from the sinoatrial (SA) node through the atria and the atrioventricular (AV) node.
    *   The notes describe this as the "working of Atrium (depolarisation - repolarisation)".
*   **PR Segment:** The flat line between the end of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex. It represents the delay of the electrical impulse at the AV node, which allows the ventricles to fill with blood.
*   **ST Segment:** The flat line between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the T wave. It represents the period when the ventricles are fully depolarized (contracted).
*   **Q-T Interval:** Measures the time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. It represents the total time for both ventricular depolarization and repolarization. The notes refer to this as the "complete operation of section of heart" (referring to the ventricles).
