# Sampling Theorem and Discrete-Time Signal Processing

This document outlines the fundamental concepts of processing continuous-time (analog) signals using digital systems. This is a core principle in modern electronics and communications, forming the basis for Digital Signal Processing (DSP).

## Discrete-Time Processing of a Continuous-Time Signal

The overall process involves converting an analog signal into a digital format, processing it digitally, and then converting it back to an analog format if needed. This can be broken down into three main stages.

1.  **Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Conversion**: The continuous-time signal `x(t)` is converted into a discrete-time, discrete-amplitude (digital) signal `x[n]`.
2.  **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**: The digital signal `x[n]` is manipulated by a processor. A common operation is **filtering**, where unwanted frequency components are removed. The output is a new digital signal `y[n]`.
3.  **Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Conversion**: The processed digital signal `y[n]` is converted back into a continuous-time signal `y(t)`, which is the filtered version of the original signal.

## Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Conversion

The A/D conversion is the crucial first step and consists of two main processes: **Sampling** and **Quantization**.

### 1. Sampling

Sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by measuring its amplitude at distinct, uniform time intervals. 

*   **Sampling Period (Ts)**: The time interval between consecutive samples.
*   **Sampling Frequency (fs)**: The number of samples taken per second, defined as `fs = 1/Ts`.

The result of sampling the signal `x(t)` is a discrete-time signal denoted as `x(nT)`, where 'n' is an integer index.

#### The Sampling Theorem & Aliasing

To accurately represent a continuous signal, the sampling frequency must be sufficiently high. The **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem** states that the sampling frequency `fs` must be at least twice the maximum frequency `f_max` present in the signal:

`fs >= 2 * f_max`

If this condition is violated, an effect known as **aliasing** occurs, where high-frequency components in the original signal impersonate lower frequencies in the sampled signal, leading to irreversible distortion.

To prevent aliasing, a **Low Pass Filter (LPF)**, often called an anti-aliasing filter, is used to remove frequencies above `fs/2` *before* the signal is sampled.

### 2. Quantization & Digitization

After sampling, the signal `x(nT)` is discrete in time but its amplitude values are still continuous. **Quantization** is the process of mapping these continuous amplitude values to a finite set of discrete levels. This completes the conversion to a fully digital signal, `x[n]`.

*   **Quantization Levels (L)**: The discrete amplitude values that the signal can take. The more levels used, the more accurate the representation.
*   **Quantization Step Size (Δ)**: The difference in amplitude between two adjacent quantization levels. In the example, `Δ = 0.2`.
*   **Quantization Error**: The difference between the actual amplitude of the sample and the amplitude of the quantization level it is mapped to. This error is inherent to the process and is bounded by `±Δ/2`.
*   **Encoding**: Each quantization level is assigned a unique binary code. The number of bits (`n`) required is related to the number of levels (`L`) by the formula `L <= 2^n`. For example, if there are 9 levels as shown in the notes, you would need `ceil(log2(9)) = 4` bits to represent all levels.
