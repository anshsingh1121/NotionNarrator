# Signal Sampling and Normalized Frequency

This document covers the fundamental concepts of sampling a continuous-time signal to convert it into a discrete-time signal, with a focus on understanding normalized frequency.

## The Sampling Process

Sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal, denoted as `x(t)`, into a discrete-time signal by taking its value at regular time intervals. 

*   **Continuous-time signal:** `x(t)`
*   **Sampling Period (`Ts`):** The time interval between consecutive samples.
*   **Sampling Frequency (`Fs`):** The number of samples taken per second, defined as the reciprocal of the sampling period: `Fs = 1/Ts`.
*   **Discrete-time signal:** The sampled signal is represented as `x(nTs)` or, more commonly, `x[n]`, where `n` is an integer representing the sample number.

The transformation is written as:
`x(t) ---[Sampling]---> x(nTs)`

## Normalized Frequency

To understand how the frequency of a signal is represented in the discrete domain, let's consider a continuous sinusoidal signal:

`x(t) = sin(2πFt)`

Here, `F` is the frequency in Hertz (Hz).

When we sample this signal at a rate of `Fs`, we replace `t` with `nTs`:

`x(nTs) = sin(2πF(nTs))`

Since `Ts = 1/Fs`, we can substitute this into the equation:

`x(nTs) = sin(2πF(n/Fs)) = sin(2π * (F/Fs) * n)`

We define a new term, **normalized frequency (`f`)**, as the ratio of the original signal's frequency (`F`) to the sampling frequency (`Fs`):

`f = F / Fs`

This quantity `f` is dimensionless (sometimes given units of cycles/sample). Using this, the discrete-time signal `x[n]` can be written as:

`x[n] = sin(2πfn)`

## Frequency Domain Comparison: Continuous vs. Discrete

There is a fundamental difference between the range of frequencies in the continuous and discrete domains.

| Domain               | Signal       | Frequency Representation         | Range                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous-Time**  | `x(t)`       | `F` (Hertz), `Ω` (rad/sec)         | `0 ≤ F < ∞`                             |
| **Discrete-Time**    | `x[n]`       | `f` (normalized), `ω` (rad/sample) | `-1/2 ≤ f < 1/2` or `-π ≤ ω < π`         |

This limited range in the discrete domain is why the **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem** is crucial. To avoid losing information (aliasing), the sampling frequency `Fs` must be at least twice the maximum frequency `F_max` present in the continuous signal (`Fs ≥ 2 * F_max`).

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Determining Normalized Frequency Range

Consider a continuous-time signal `x(t)` whose frequency content is limited to the range of **0 Hz to 100 Hz**.

1.  **Find the minimum sampling frequency (`Fs`)**: According to the Nyquist theorem, `Fs` must be at least `2 * F_max`. Here, `F_max = 100 Hz`.
    `Fs ≥ 2 * 100 Hz  =>  Fs ≥ 200 Hz`

2.  **Calculate the normalized frequency range**: Let's use the minimum sampling frequency, `Fs = 200 Hz`. The normalized frequency `f` is given by `f = F/Fs`.
    *   The lower bound is `F = 0 Hz`, so `f_min = 0 / 200 = 0`.
    *   The upper bound is `F = 100 Hz`, so `f_max = 100 / 200 = 0.5`.

Therefore, the frequency range of the resulting discrete-time signal `x[n]` is **`0 ≤ f ≤ 0.5`**.

### Example 2: Sampling Multiple Signals

Suppose we have two signals:
*   `x1(t)` with a frequency range of (0, 100) Hz.
*   `x2(t)` with a frequency range of (0, 50) Hz.

Let's sample each at its respective Nyquist rate:

1.  **For `x1(t)`**: `F_max1 = 100 Hz`. The minimum sampling rate is `Fs1 = 2 * 100 = 200 Hz`. The normalized frequency range becomes:
    `(0/Fs1, F_max1/Fs1) = (0/200, 100/200) = (0, 0.5)`.
    In terms of normalized angular frequency `ω = 2πf`, this is `(0, π)`.

2.  **For `x2(t)`**: `F_max2 = 50 Hz`. The minimum sampling rate is `Fs2 = 2 * 50 = 100 Hz`. The normalized frequency range becomes:
    `(0/Fs2, F_max2/Fs2) = (0/100, 50/100) = (0, 0.5)`.
    In terms of `ω`, this is also `(0, π)`.

**Key Takeaway:**
When comparing or processing multiple signals together in the discrete domain, it is essential to use the **same sampling frequency (`Fs`) for all signals**. This common `Fs` must be chosen based on the highest frequency component among all signals.

`F_max_overall = max(F_max1, F_max2, ..., F_maxn)`
`Fs ≥ 2 * F_max_overall`

For the example above, the correct approach would be to sample both `x1(t)` and `x2(t)` at `Fs ≥ 2 * max(100, 50)`, meaning `Fs ≥ 200 Hz`.
