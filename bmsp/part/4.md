# Signal Propagation Mechanism in Excitable Cells

This document explains the mechanism of signal propagation in excitable cells, such as neurons, focusing on a pressure-sensitive neuron. The core of this mechanism is the **action potential**, a rapid, temporary change in the cell's membrane potential.

## 1. The Resting State and Ion Channels

An excitable cell at rest maintains a **Resting Membrane Potential (RMP)**, which is typically around -70mV. This negative charge inside the cell relative to the outside is established and maintained by several key components embedded in the cell membrane.

*   **Na+/K+ ATPase Pump:** This active transport protein pumps three Sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell for every two Potassium ions (K+) it pumps in. This action consumes ATP and is crucial for maintaining the steep concentration gradients for both ions across the membrane.
*   **Leaky K+ Channels:** These channels are always open, allowing K+ ions to diffuse out of the cell down their concentration gradient (from high concentration inside, ~140 mmole/lt, to low concentration outside, ~4 mmole/lt). This outflow of positive charge is the primary contributor to the negative RMP.
*   **Voltage-Gated Channels:** These channels are closed at rest but open in response to changes in the membrane potential. There are specific voltage-gated channels for Na+ and K+, which are essential for generating the action potential.
*   **Stimulus-Gated Channels:** In this specific example of a pressure-sensitive neuron, there are mechanically-gated channels that open in response to physical pressure.

## 2. The Action Potential Cycle

The action potential is a stereotyped sequence of events that occurs when a stimulus depolarizes the membrane to a specific **threshold** value (around -60mV). It follows an 'all-or-none' principle: if the threshold is reached, a full action potential is fired; if not, nothing happens.

The cycle can be broken down into the following phases:

1.  **Stimulus and Initial Depolarization:** A mechanical stimulus (pressure) opens pressure-sensitive channels, allowing Na+ to flow into the cell. This influx of positive ions makes the membrane potential less negative, causing it to rise from the RMP of -70mV.

2.  **Threshold and Rapid Depolarization:** If the initial stimulus is strong enough to depolarize the membrane to the threshold potential (~-60mV), voltage-gated Na+ channels are triggered to open. This results in a massive, rapid influx of Na+, causing the membrane potential to shoot up towards a peak of about +10mV. This phase is the **depolarization** or the rising phase of the action potential.

3.  **Repolarization:** At the peak of the action potential, the voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate, stopping the influx of Na+. Simultaneously, the slower voltage-gated K+ channels open. K+ ions rush out of the cell, down their electrochemical gradient, causing the membrane potential to rapidly fall back towards the resting level. This is the **repolarization** or falling phase.

4.  **Hyperpolarization (Undershoot):** The voltage-gated K+ channels are slow to close. As a result, they remain open slightly longer than necessary, allowing excess K+ to leave the cell. This causes the membrane potential to briefly become more negative than the RMP, a phase known as **hyperpolarization**.

5.  **Return to Resting State:** The voltage-gated K+ channels finally close. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump continues to work to restore the original ion concentration gradients, bringing the membrane potential back to its resting level of -70mV.

## 3. Refractory Periods

Following an action potential, the neuron enters a state where it is less responsive to new stimuli.

*   **Absolute Refractory Period:** During depolarization and most of repolarization, the voltage-gated Na+ channels are either already open or in an inactivated state. In this period, it is impossible to generate a second action potential, regardless of the stimulus strength.

*   **Relative Refractory Period:** During hyperpolarization, the membrane is more negative than at rest. While the Na+ channels have reset, a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required to depolarize the membrane all the way to the threshold to fire another action potential.
